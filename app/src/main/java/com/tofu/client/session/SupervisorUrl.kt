/**
 * Pure (Android-free) derivation of the supervisor's base URL from a profile's
 * Tofu server URL, and endpoint building. Unit-testable without a device.
 *
 * The supervisor is proxied by the SAME code-server as Tofu, one port up
 * (Tofu 15000 → supervisor 15001). So a server URL like
 * `https://<host>/proxy/15000/` maps to `https://<host>/proxy/15001` and the
 * control endpoints hang off that (`…/proxy/15001/status`, `/start`, `/stop`).
 *
 * When the Tofu port cannot be found in the path (a non-proxy deployment), we
 * fall back to the origin root + the default supervisor port path
 * `/proxy/<TOFU_SUPERVISOR_PORT>` so the same shape still works behind a proxy.
